        <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/blogs/System_Architecture">Understanding System Architecture Through Human Emotions</a></h2>
        <p class="post-meta">Posted by Saravanesh on November 25, 2024</p>
        <p>When I was a developer, it felt like I was solving puzzles in isolation, unaware of how they fit into the bigger picture. I’d code, test, and deliver without fully grasping how my work impacted the lives of people who used the software. As years passed, I began to see the patterns—like pieces of a story coming together. I realized that understanding the purpose and business need of an application is as crucial as writing the code itself. And what better way to explain this than by drawing parallels with something deeply relatable: human emotions and relationships?</p>
        <p>Just as humans are a textile of emotions working in harmony, system architecture is a collection of interconnected components working together to create seamless experiences. Let’s break this down, one emotion at a time.</p>
        <h3>1. Frontend: The Smile You Show the World</h3>
        <p>Think of the frontend as a person’s expression—the smile, the gestures, the tone of voice. It’s what people see first and how they judge your mood and intentions. For a system, the frontend is the website or app interface. It’s the friendly face of your system, guiding users to what they need while making them feel comfortable and welcome.</p>
        <p>When a grocery store app makes it easy to browse and shop, it’s like a friend with a warm smile who says, “I’m here for you. Let me help.”</p>
        <h3>2. Backend: The Heart of the Matter</h3>
        <p>The backend is the emotional core—the place where thoughts, decisions, and processes originate. Just as your emotions guide your actions, the backend drives the logic of an application. It processes your requests, ensures everything runs smoothly, and communicates with other systems.</p>
        <p>Imagine placing an order on your grocery app. The backend works like the emotions behind the scenes, ensuring the right responses are triggered: “They’re hungry? Let’s make sure the order is prepared on time.”</p>
        <h3>3. Database: The Memory That Holds It All</h3>
        <p>Memories shape who we are. Similarly, the database is the repository of all past experiences for a system—storing customer details, product inventories, and order histories. It’s like the collective memory that helps us learn, grow, and adapt.</p>
        <p>When you re-order your favorite snack from the grocery store, the database recalls your preferences, like a friend who remembers your coffee order without asking.</p>
        <h3>4. APIs: The Conversations We Have</h3>
        <p>APIs are the conversations between systems, just as communication is the lifeline of relationships. They ensure everyone is on the same page, connecting payment gateways, delivery services, and tracking systems.</p>
        <p>It’s like calling a friend to confirm dinner plans: “Are you ready? Should I pick you up?” APIs keep things moving smoothly, ensuring all parts work in harmony.</p>
        <h3>5. Load Balancer: Managing Stress with Grace</h3>
        <p>Life throws challenges at us, and how we manage stress determines our resilience. The load balancer is like emotional regulation—it ensures no part of the system is overwhelmed.</p>
        <p>Imagine a busy grocery app during festive seasons. The load balancer ensures every server shares the load, much like how a calm mind helps you juggle multiple tasks without losing focus.</p>
        <h3>6. Cloud: The Capacity to Grow and Adapt</h3>
        <p>Our capacity to grow, adapt, and expand our horizons mirrors the cloud. Just as we find strength during tough times or grow when faced with challenges, the cloud scales the system to handle increasing demands.</p>
        <p>During a sale, when thousands of people log in to shop, the cloud expands resources, much like how we tap into reserves of patience and strength when life demands more from us.</p>
        <h3>7. Security: The Guardrails of Trust</h3>
        <p>Trust is the foundation of any relationship, just as security is the backbone of any system. It protects personal data, payment details, and sensitive information, ensuring users feel safe and cared for.</p>
        <p>Think of it as a protective instinct, like when a parent ensures their child crosses the road safely. Security creates a safe environment for users to engage without worry.</p>
        <h3>8. DevOps: The Caretaker of Relationships</h3>
        <p>DevOps is like the invisible support system in relationships—the person who keeps things running, fixes issues, and ensures the connection remains strong. It’s the team that releases updates, fixes bugs, and enhances features without disrupting the user experience.</p>
        <p>In our grocery store analogy, DevOps ensures that the app is always improving—adding faster delivery options or personalizing your experience, just like how effort keeps a relationship alive and thriving.</p>
        <h3>9. The Big Picture: An Online Grocery Store and Human Life</h3>
        <p>Bringing it all together is like seeing the connection of human emotions. Every system component works like an emotion or action in a human being, creating a harmonious experience.</p>
        <p>Let’s take an online grocery store as an example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Frontend:</b>The smile that greets you when you open the app.</li>
            <li><b>Backend:</b>The heart that processes your needs and makes decisions.</li>
            <li><b>Database:</b>The memory that recalls your favorite items.</li>
            <li><b>APIs:</b>The conversations that coordinate between payment, delivery, and tracking.</li>
            <li><b>Load Balancer:</b>The calm under pressure during a rush hour.</li>
            <li><b>Cloud:</b>The ability to adapt and grow during busy times.</li>
            <li><b>Security:</b>The trust that ensures your data is safe.</li>
            <li><b>DevOps:</b>The ongoing effort to keep improving and maintaining the relationship.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>As developers, when we look beyond the lines of code, we see the bigger picture. Just as emotions make us human, system architecture brings life to applications. Understanding the purpose behind every layer helps us build better systems and create a more profound impact in the real world.</p>
        <p>So, next time you design or build something, think about the human emotions it mirrors. The more empathy you bring to your code, the better your creations will resonate with the people who use them.</p>
        <p>Building Better Systems, One Emotion at a Time!</p>

        <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/blogs/Gen_AI_Reform_Database_Languages">How GenAI Could Transform Our Language with Database</a></h2>
        <p class="post-meta">Posted by Saravanesh on November 12, 2024</p>
        <p>The languages we use to communicate—whether with each other or with computers—have always evolved, moving from rigid codes to intuitive, natural interactions. Just as spoken languages change, computer languages are poised to do the same. One of the biggest transformations could be the way we retrieve data: a future where SQL and its structured commands give way to fluid, conversational AI-driven queries.</p>
        <p>Imagine asking a database, “What were last quarter’s sales?” and receiving instant, relevant insights without needing to know SQL syntax. With GenAI, we could interact with data naturally, bridging the gap between rigid database commands and flexible, accessible querying.</p>
        <p><strong>Replacing SQL with Natural Language</strong></p>
        <p>Traditionally, accessing data in SQL requires knowing technical details—table names, fields, and conditions—to build queries. GenAI, however, could interpret plain language requests, making data retrieval as simple as asking a question. Developers and business users alike would benefit from a system that adapts to their language, eliminating the need to learn or remember specific syntax. This approach would make the data itself more accessible, empowering everyone to make data-informed decisions.</p>
        <p><strong>Unified Access to All Data Types</p></strong>
        <p>One of the most exciting capabilities GenAI could unlock is the unification of all data types—structured, semi-structured, and unstructured—under one querying system. Instead of enforcing rigid tables and schemas, AI could index data on-the-fly, allowing retrieval from various sources: structured databases, customer emails, sales reports, even multimedia files. This ability to cross-query without restructuring could bring previously siloed information together, making insights more immediate and relevant.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="https://bgtech-blog-posts-backend.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog_gen_ai.png" alt="staying-ahead" style="max-width: 40%; height: auto;">
        </div>
        <p><strong>Visual and Interactive Data Manipulation</strong></p>
        <p>Imagine a future where querying data doesn’t require code but works through an interactive, visual interface. Dragging and dropping fields or highlighting areas of interest, users could explore data instantly, with GenAI recalculating and refining results as they go. This level of interaction would make working with data feel as simple as sorting through a file cabinet—only vastly faster and smarter.</p>
        <p><strong>Databases Optimized for AI</strong></p>
        <p>In the future, databases could be designed with AI in mind, shifting from rigid structures to more adaptive formats. Instead of enforcing strict schemas, databases could evolve to allow on-the-fly indexing and dynamic organization. This adaptability would enable natural language questions to pull data directly, making retrieval not only faster but more flexible and accessible.</p>
        <p><strong>Vector Searching: The Next Frontier in Data Querying</strong></p>
        <p>In addition to natural language querying, another powerful concept that could revolutionize how we retrieve data is vector searching. Traditional relational databases rely on structured queries like SQL to fetch exact matches from tables, whereas vector searching leverages machine learning to understand the meaning behind the data.</p>
        <p>Vector databases use embeddings—high-dimensional representations of data—to perform similarity searches. Instead of matching exact keywords, a vector search can find related data based on context. For example, a query for "best-selling products in Q1" could return related results based on customer preferences, trends, or other patterns that might not exactly match the query but are contextually relevant.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenges and the Path Ahead</strong></p>
        <p>This shift from SQL to GenAI-driven querying won’t be without its challenges. Ensuring accuracy, context, and security in AI-driven data retrieval will require advancements in AI accuracy and access control. But if these hurdles can be overcome, GenAI could make data access universally available and intuitive.</p>
        <p>As I experiment with building this kind of GenAI-enabled tool, I’m exploring how it can unify data, simplify access, and make retrieval secure—all while eliminating the language barrier between users and databases. This could redefine how we interact with data at the developer level and beyond, and I’ll be sharing more of my insights in upcoming blog posts.</p>

        <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/blogs/Staying-Ahead">Staying Ahead: How to Spot Trending Tech for IT Engineers</a></h2>
        <p class="post-meta">Posted by Saravanesh on October 10, 2024</p>
        <p>In the past, mastering languages like Java or .NET or some SQL tools was enough for a solid career. But today, companies want more—engineers who can code and work with cloud platforms, deployment tools, automation, data analytics, machine learning and the lists go on.</p>
        <h3>The Shift from Language-Centric to Ecosystem-Centric Learning</h3>
        <p>Back then, being a “Java Developer” was the goal. Now, it’s about the ecosystem—companies need engineers who can deploy apps on AWS, manage Kubernetes clusters, and automate infrastructure. I’ve been through this change myself. A few years ago, I made the switch from Mainframe to AWS. I saw firsthand how important it is to not only adapt but to continuously evolve with the industry.</p>
        <p>What’s even more surprising is that this shift isn’t just for people with IT backgrounds. I’ve seen a 20-year chemistry teacher and a 7-year civil engineer transition into AWS DevOps roles through learning the right tools and skills. The opportunities are there—you just need to know how to align your learning with the market.</p>
        <h3>Steps to Stay Updated:</h3>
        <ul>

        <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/blogs/Sync-vs-Async">Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Operations</a></h2>
        <p class="post-meta">Posted by Saravanesh on August 20, 2024</p>
        <p>In computing, the concepts of synchronous and asynchronous operations often come up. But these ideas aren’t limited to code; they exist in everyday experiences too. Take, for example, a recent visit to two different cinemas.</p>
        <p>At PVR cinemas, the process was straightforward. I placed my order at the counter, and the attendant completed it before moving on to the next customer. This is a textbook example of a synchronous operation. Each step follows the previous one, and nothing else happens until the current task is finished. It’s efficient in its own way but requires patience.</p>
        <p>In contrast, at another cinema, I placed my order at one counter and collected it at another. This approach exemplifies asynchronous operations. Multiple tasks were handled simultaneously: while my payment was being processed, someone else was preparing my order. The result? Faster service with tasks running in parallel, although slightly less structured.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="https://bgtech-blog-posts-bkend.s3.ap-south-2.amazonaws.com/Blog_Sync_vs_Async.gif" alt="Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Operations" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        </div>
        <p>These two experiences highlight the fundamental difference between synchronous and asynchronous operations. In a synchronous system, tasks are completed one after another, ensuring that each step is fully executed before the next begins. This method is useful when order and sequence are crucial. Asynchronous systems, on the other hand, allow tasks to occur concurrently, improving overall speed but introducing complexity in managing those tasks.</p>
        <p>Understanding these concepts is key in both programming and system design, whether you’re optimizing a codebase or simply waiting in line for popcorn.</p>

        <p class="post-meta">Posted by Saravanesh on August 11, 2024</p>
        <p>Picture this: A future species stumbles upon the remnants of our civilization and concludes that it wasn’t a catastrophic event or an epic battle that led to our demise, but the quiet, steady grind of small businesses trying to keep up with the relentless demands of modern life. It sounds a bit dramatic, doesn’t it? But if you’re a small business owner, the daily pressures can sometimes feel overwhelming. Fortunately, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is here to offer a helping hand—not with magnificent gestures, but with the subtle magic of algorithms and data. And the best part? You don’t need to be a tech savvy to harness its power.</p>
        <p>Imagine AI as that overenthusiastic intern who’s always eager to take on the tasks you’d rather not deal with. Sorting through countless emails, managing inventory, scheduling appointments—these aren’t exactly the highlights of running a business. Yet, AI thrives on these mundane tasks. Tools like Zapier or Xero can manage the day-to-day work so you can focus on what truly matters. Perhaps, with AI handling the particulars, you’ll find a rare moment to breathe and dream up the next big idea, rather than being continually buried in spreadsheets and to-do lists.</p>
        <p>Customer service can sometimes feel like that—customers reaching out, hoping for a prompt reply, only to be left hanging. AI changes this dynamic completely. With chatbots like Tidio and ManyChat, your business can offer round-the-clock assistance, ensuring that customers get the help they need, whenever they need it. It’s as if you’ve cloned yourself, and the clone never sleeps, never gets frustrated, and always maintains a polite, helpful manner.</p>
        <p>Marketing used to feel a bit like tossing a message in a bottle into the vast ocean, hoping that it eventually washes ashore in the right hands. AI, however, lets you skip the guesswork. It allows you to hand-deliver your message to the exact person who needs to hear it, right when they’re ready to listen. Tools like Mailchimp and HubSpot analyze customer data in ways that would make Sherlock Holmes green with envy, helping you craft personalized campaigns that resonate deeply with your audience.</p>
        <p>We like to think that our business decisions are rooted in logic and careful consideration, but if we’re honest, many of them are more like shots in the dark. Enter AI, with its ability to process vast amounts of data faster than you can say “spreadsheet.” With the insights provided by tools like Google Analytics or IBM Watson Analytics, you can turn those wild guesses into informed decisions, steering your business with confidence instead of crossing your fingers and hoping for the best. AI offers a clearer view of the road ahead, helping you avoid those “Oops, maybe that wasn’t the best idea” moments.</p>
        <p>Running a small business can sometimes feel like navigating a spaceship through the cosmos, trying to make every drop of fuel count. AI is like that smart onboard system constantly fine-tuning the settings to ensure maximum efficiency. Whether it’s optimizing energy usage with tools like Nest or reducing waste in your supply chain, AI helps you cut costs so effectively that you might wonder if it’s performing some kind of sorcery. Yet, it’s not magic—just the power of technology working quietly in the background to help your business thrive.</p>
        <p>In our increasingly digital world, cyber threats are the shadows lurking in every corner. But AI serves as your vigilant watchdog, tirelessly scanning for any sign of trouble. With tools like Darktrace and Cylance, your business benefits from real-time protection that responds faster than any human ever could. It’s like having a digital bodyguard on duty 24/7, ensuring that your data remains safe and secure while you focus on growing your business.</p>
        <p>We like to think we’re the pinnacle of evolution on this little blue rock, but even the most advanced species could use a helping hand now and then. AI offers small businesses the tools to not just survive but thrive, all without the need for a massive budget or a team of tech wizards. So, while the future might be uncertain, with AI by your side, your business has a pretty good shot at success. And who knows—maybe someday, a future species will dig up your achievements and be genuinely impressed.</p>

        <p class="post-meta">Posted by Saravanesh on April 4, 2024</p>
        <p>The synchronization of data between AWS and on-premises systems represents a pivotal challenge in today's hybrid computing landscape. My exposure to this intricate process came through practical implementation within my professional environment, shedding light on its complexities and nuances.</p>
        <p>When the system was migrated to the cloud, I faced the challenge of learning a new technology stack. I familiarized myself with cloud computing concepts such as virtualization, containerization, and serverless computing. I also learned about specific cloud services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and Amazon Lambda.</p>
        <p>I’ve been able to navigate the intricacies of AWS and database management, albeit with a learning curve. The realization dawned upon me that in the vast expanse of cloud computing and data management, there's always more to explore and comprehend.</p>
        <p>Central to our synchronization strategy is Amazon Database Migration Service (DMS), a robust tool facilitating seamless data replication across disparate environments. DMS operates as the linchpin of our setup, diligently capturing changes from our on-premises Postgres SQL database and mirroring them in near real-time on AWS. This ensures that our data remains synchronized across both platforms, vital for our operational continuity and decision-making processes.</p>
        <p>Complementing DMS is the implementation of a temporary schema within our Postgres SQL database. This schema acts as a staging area, enabling the aggregation and validation of incoming data changes before they are integrated into the main database. This approach not only safeguards data integrity but also streamlines the synchronization process, minimizing disruptions and maximizing efficiency.</p>
        <p>To orchestrate the synchronization tasks seamlessly, we rely on cron job schedulers. These schedulers are configured to trigger synchronization operations at predetermined intervals, ensuring that data updates are propagated swiftly and without human intervention. This automation not only enhances operational efficiency but also reduces the risk of human error, critical in maintaining data consistency across environments.</p>
        <p>While our synchronization methodology proves effective, it's not without its challenges, notably in terms of cost management. As data volumes grow and synchronization demands increase, the associated costs can escalate rapidly. To mitigate this, we're exploring various cost optimization strategies.</p>
        <p>These strategies include optimizing resource utilization, leveraging open-source solutions, implementing change data capture mechanisms, exploring hybrid storage options, and utilizing AWS Spot Instances and Spot Fleets. By embracing these approaches, we aim to strike a balance between cost-effectiveness and operational excellence, ensuring that our data synchronization efforts remain sustainable and scalable.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the synchronization of data between AWS and on-premises systems is a multifaceted endeavor, demanding a nuanced approach and ongoing refinement. Through the integration of Amazon DMS, Postgres SQL, and meticulous cost optimization strategies, we're able to achieve near real-time data synchronization while navigating the complexities of the cloud computing landscape.</p>
